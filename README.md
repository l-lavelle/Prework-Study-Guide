  # Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
I built this project to learn and practice working with HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript on my journey to become a web developer. I learned that HMTL is the basis of a website defining the structure. Then CSS is used to define style rules for specific elements of HTML page. Javascript is used to add interactivity to the site. Git is version control used to manage and keep track of changes while coding. This website was created to keep notes about topics learned in order to review content and practice with code.
